Thank you for signing up for the Code Devotional mailing list and welcome to our first mailing! We promise two things: these emails won't be frequent and we'll do our best to make them worthwhile to read.

We've been thinking a lot about naming. It's an interesting and deep topic, and perhaps one of the [hardest things in programming](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). The article below discusses some guidelines for naming methods. We hope you enjoy it.

One of our core principles at Code Devotional is fostering community. In that spirit, we've set up a Github repository to collect feedback: https://github.com/codedevotional/community/issues. We're going to record a podcast discussing this article soon, so if you have any questions or comments about naming, please post an issue there so that we may discuss it. But your questions and feedback don't have to be about naming. They can be about anything code-related.

Thank you again for being the initial cohort of our nascent community devoted to continuous learning about code.

Cheers!

- Sandi & TJ
