Thank you for signing up for the Code Devotional mailing list and welcome to our first mailing! We promise two things: these emails won't be frequent and we'll make them worthwhile to read.

We've been thinking a lot about naming. It's an interesting and deep topic, and perhaps one of the [hardest things in programming](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). The article below discusses some guidelines for naming methods. We hope you enjoy it.

One of our core principles at Code Devotional is fostering community. In that spirit, we've set up a Github repository to collect your feedback, ruminations, and requests. We'll soon be recording a podcast where we discuss this article, so if you have questions or comments, please [post an issue](https://github.com/codedevotional/community/issues)! And if you have something else on your mind, well, post that, and we'll address it in a future episode.

Thanks again for signing up for the initial cohort of our nascent community devoted to continuous learning about code.

Cheers!

- Sandi & TJ
